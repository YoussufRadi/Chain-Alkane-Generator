# Chain-Alkane-Generator
<br><h3>
Project Description
</h4>
<p>
Hydrocarbons are compounds composed of carbon and hydrogen. An alkane is a saturated hydrocar-
bon. Each carbon atom is bound to the maximum number possible: Four atoms. Alkanes can have their atoms arranged in what is called a normal, straight-chain or unbranched way.
</p>
<p>
Alkanes with at least four carbon atoms exhibit structural isomerism. This is because they can exist not only as straight-chain molecules, but also in a branched-chain structure. For instance, the alkane with four carbon atoms has two isomers and the alkane with five carbon atoms has three isomers.
</p>

<p>
longest chain of three carbon atoms and a branch of CH3. While generating the different isomers of some formula, finding the distinct ones can be a bit tricky. Some structures appear to be additional isomers when, in fact, they are identical to already generated ones once rotated and/or mirrored. This project is a system for alkane isomers generation according to some specific rules.
